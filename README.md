# Tableau-Authorize.net
This is very small sample Tableau 9.1 web data connector to Authorize.Net just to show the capability how to load data from Authorize.Net directly to Tableau.

- I use getUnsettledTransactionListRequest call (just to illustrate the capability). Please see Authorize.Net documentation for more details http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/index.html#transaction-reporting-get-unsettled-transaction-list

- in theory, the incremental refresh should work as well

- the way I handle keys is really not the way it should be done for production purposes. While convinient, it safes the access keys with the report

- I use JSON calls, while still in beta I feel we should not go back to XML ever again for cases like this ;-)

- CSS comes from Saran Chamling and his really nice samples http://www.sanwebe.com/2014/08/css-html-forms-designs 


thank you [Brian](https://github.com/brianmc) for not killing me for my constant bitching about API standards


#How to run it

- get your Authorize.Net Sandbox Login ID and Transaction Key
- by default Transaction API is disabled, you have to login to Authorize.Net console and enable it

- simply clone this repo
- start simpple web server e.g. python ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888``` or ruby ```ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8888``` in the same directory 

- open Tableau, select "Web Data Connector" as a datasource
- paste this link http://localhost:8888/AuthorizeNet.html
- use the Login ID and Transaction Key generated by Authorize.Net


#cURL calls

in case anybody wants to play with cURL and is wondering with Authorize.Net docs lack of simple cURL samples, here it is

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '
{
    "getUnsettledTransactionListRequest": {
        "merchantAuthentication": {
            "name": "YOUR_API_ID",
            "transactionKey": "TRANSACTION_KEY"
        }
    }
}
